# AI for Automated Medical Image Annotation

This project is an AI-based tool designed to assist radiologists by automatically annotating medical images such as MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to upload their medical images, which are then processed by machine learning models to highlight significant areas for further examination.

## Features

- User authentication (Signup and Login)
- Image upload and processing for MRI and X-Ray
- Display of processed images with highlighted areas
- Responsive design for ease of use on various devices

## Technologies Used

- *Frontend*: React.js
- *Backend*: Node.js with Express.js
- *Database*: MongoDB
- *Image Processing*: TensorFlow (Keras) for model inference
- *Deployment*: Flask for serving the image processing model
- *Styling*: CSS, Boxicons for icons
